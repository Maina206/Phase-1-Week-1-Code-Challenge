## Description 
The coding challenge is divided into three challenges:
1. Student Grade Generator
2. Speed Detector
3. Net Salary Calculator


## Project setup 
### Student Grade Generator
The challenge involved creating a program that prompts students to input their marks, which are between 0 and 100 and then assigning them a grade depending on their marks.


### Speed Detector
The second challenge involved creating a program that takes as input the speed of a car.I+f the driver is driving below the speed limit, which is 70, the program informs they are 'OK'. but if the speed is above the speed limit the driver is penalised with 1 demerit point for every 5km/s above the limit. If the demerit points exceed 12, the driver's license is suspended. 


### Net Salary Calculator
The final challenge involved creating a program that calculates an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. The program then calculates and outputs the employee's payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary (keep in mid this is calculated monthly). The program used the latest rates from KRA.
